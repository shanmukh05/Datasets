# [Go to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shanmukh05/traffic-sign-cropped)

## Context
Following Dataset can be used for multi class classification.

## Content
Dataset contains a `dataset` folder.
Inside dataset folder there are `43` folders containing different traffic signs. Thare are a total of arounf `27000` images.

Original data present in [GTSRB](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html) contains images in `ppm` format.

I cropped the images with annotations given in the before mentioned dataset and converted images to `jpg` format.
